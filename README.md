# Robotics Challenges

These challenges are:
- Intended to be learning experiences
- To host friendly competitions
- Written in an assignment specification format
- Targeted for UNSW students :)
- Accessible and cheap for everyone involved
- Doable within 2 months as a student, or 1-2 weeks full time
- Not guided (guided material for learning already exists everywhere)
