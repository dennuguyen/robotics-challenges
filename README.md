# Sumofun

A series of assignments designed to teach you how to build a simple sumobot. All assignments are marked based on the quality of your work and we will give feedback.

The aim of this document is to do all the project planning and high-level design for you. All you have to do is follow the steps and figure out how you want to implement things.

## Arduino Programming

### Learning Outcome

- Flashing programs to an Arduino board.
- Reading and writing to Arduino with serial monitor.
- Programming on an Arduino with use of loops, if statements and functions.
- Debugging practices.

### Instructions


## More Arduino Programming

### Learning Outcome

- Source and header files.
- Writing classes: constructors, methods, member variables, objects.

## Electrical Tools

- Soldering pin headers and splicing.
- Insulating with heat shrink.
- Debugging with multimeter.

## Mechanical Design

### Learning Outcome

- CAD software.
- Sourcing and comparing part models.

### Instructions

1. Create a CAD model of a sumobot that meets the following requirements:

Consider how you mount all your electronic peripherals and wiring.

## Simple Driving

### Learning Outcome

### Instructions

1. Start with 

## Distance sensing with HC-SR04

The HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor used for distance sensing.

## Line sensing with IR Flying Fish

## Connecting to Arduino Uno via WiFi

### Learning Outcome

- Using ESP-01 WiFi module.

### Instructions

## Optimisation

By this point, your robot should be able to drive around and react quite simply to the environment.

If you ever need to confirm that your components are working then run the scripts you've developed before.

We can now improve our robot by identifying points of optimisation:
- Speed does not vary
- 

Revisit previous parts and improve reliability.

## Speed Control

## Strategy

## Pushing Opponents Out

## Staying In-Bounds

## Following Opponents
